Addis Ababa University (AAU) implements a cost-sharing policy in line with Ethiopia's national framework for higher education financing. This policy mandates that students contribute to the costs of their education, thereby promoting shared responsibility between the government and students.

**Key Components of the Cost-Sharing Scheme:**

1. **Tuition Fees:**
   - Students are required to cover 15% of their tuition costs. The remaining 85% is subsidized by the government. This contribution is intended to instill a sense of investment and accountability among students regarding their education.

2. **Boarding and Meal Expenses:**
   - Students are responsible for the full cost of their boarding and meal services. These costs are calculated based on the actual expenses incurred by the university to provide these services.

3. **Graduate Tax:**
   - Upon securing employment after graduation, students are obligated to repay the accumulated costs through a graduate tax. This tax is typically set at 10% of the graduate's income until the debt is fully settled.

**Implementation and Management:**

- **Agreements:**
  - At the commencement of their studies, students enter into formal agreements outlining their financial obligations under the cost-sharing scheme. These agreements detail the terms of repayment and the responsibilities of both the student and the university.

- **Service Delivery:**
  - AAU has established policies to ensure efficient and timely delivery of cost-sharing services. For instance, students who do not receive accommodation from the university are provided with cash payments to cover their living expenses. The university aims to process these payments promptly, typically within three days after student registration and subsequently from the 26th to the 28th of each month.

- **Monitoring and Coordination:**
  - The university's Cost-Sharing Coordination Office is responsible for managing the scheme. This includes processing payments, maintaining records, and ensuring compliance with the established guidelines. The office also collaborates with external bodies, such as the Ethiopian Revenues and Customs Authority, to facilitate the collection of the graduate tax.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

- **Awareness and Understanding:**
  - Studies have indicated that there is a need for increased awareness among students regarding the purpose and benefits of the cost-sharing scheme. Enhancing understanding can lead to better compliance and a more positive perception of the policy.

- **Administrative Coordination:**
  - Effective implementation of the cost-sharing policy requires robust coordination among various stakeholders, including the Ministry of Education, the university administration, and tax authorities. Challenges in coordination can lead to inefficiencies and affect the overall success of the scheme.

In summary, AAU's cost-sharing policy is designed to balance the financial responsibilities of higher education between the government and students. While the policy aims to promote shared investment in education, its success hinges on effective implementation, clear communication, and strong coordination among all involved parties.
