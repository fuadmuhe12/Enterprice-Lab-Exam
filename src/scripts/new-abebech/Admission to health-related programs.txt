Admission to health-related programs at Addis Ababa University (AAU), including Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Pharmacy, is a comprehensive and competitive process designed to select the most qualified candidates. Below is an in-depth overview of the admission procedures for these programs:

**1. Eligibility Criteria:**

   - **Educational Background:** Applicants must have completed their secondary education and obtained the Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Certificate Examination (EHEECE). For international applicants, equivalent qualifications recognized by the Ministry of Education are required.

   - **Academic Performance:** A strong academic record, particularly in natural sciences, is essential. The specific cut-off marks for eligibility are determined by the Ministry of Education and may vary annually based on the applicant pool.

**2. Application Process:**

   - **Centralized Placement:** The initial placement into undergraduate programs, including health sciences, is managed by the Ministry of Education. Students are assigned to universities based on their EHEECE results, preferences, and available capacity.

   - **Preference Submission:** Once placed at AAU, first-year students are required to indicate their preferred programs. This is done through the university's online portal, where students rank their choices among available disciplines. For health-related fields, options typically include Medicine, Dental Medicine, Pharmacy, and other health sciences.

**3. Screening for Entrance Examination Eligibility:**

   - **Criteria for Selection:** Not all students are automatically eligible to sit for the entrance exams for Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Pharmacy. The university screens candidates based on a combination of their EHEECE scores and first-semester GPA. Only those who meet the set criteria are invited to take the entrance examination.

**5. Selection and Placement:**

   - **Evaluation Criteria:** The selection process for these competitive programs considers a composite score derived from:

     - EHEECE results

     - First-semester GPA

     - Entrance examination performance

   - **Notification of Results:** Candidates who successfully pass the entrance examination and meet the required criteria are notified of their acceptance into their chosen program. Those who do not qualify are placed into other programs based on their preferences and academic performance.

**6. Additional Considerations:**

   - **Program Structure:** It's important to note that programs like Medicine and Dental Medicine at AAU follow a modular system rather than a traditional semester-based structure. This approach may influence the scheduling and delivery of courses. ([admission.aau.edu.et](https://admission.aau.edu.et/faq?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
